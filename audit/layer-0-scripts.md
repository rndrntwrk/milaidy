# Layer 0 — Build / orchestration scripts

**Files: 213** (78 root + 135 app-core).
**Audited: 213 / 213.**
**Refactored: 0 / 213.**

These scripts run *outside* the runtime: postinstall, dev orchestration,
build, release, CI, cross-package patches. They are the actual root of
the dependency graph — every other layer's output depends on these
having run first.

## Why this layer first

- Several scripts (`patch-elizaos-*`, `apply-eliza-ci-patches.mjs`,
  `repair-elizaos-package-links.mjs`, `restore-workspace-refs.mjs`,
  `relink-workspace-packages-to-dist.mjs`) modify other packages on
  disk. We can't trust audits of those packages until we know what
  these scripts have rewritten.
- The two `dev-platform.mjs` / `dev-ui.mjs` orchestrators decide which
  ports the runtime binds and which env vars reach the renderer.
  Layer 2 (Electrobun) and Layer 3 (runtime) both inherit their
  contract from these. The port-shift bug fixed in MASTER.md §0 came
  from this contract being implicit.
- `lib/` modules (both root and app-core) define the shared
  primitives: port allocation, repo discovery, env aliases, version
  guards. Anything they get wrong propagates.

## Audit axes (per AUDIT.md)

For each file: **dedup, types, dead, cycles, errors, legacy, slop, boundaries.**

## What to look for in this layer specifically

- **Duplicate scripts** between `scripts/` (root) and
  `eliza/packages/app-core/scripts/` (e.g. both have `init-submodules.mjs`,
  `setup-upstreams.mjs`, `validate-cdn-assets.mjs`, `write-build-info.ts`,
  `disable-local-eliza-workspace.mjs`, `run-release-contract-suite.mjs`,
  `run-production-build.mjs`, `write-homepage-release-data.mjs`) — pick
  one canonical owner.
- **`patch-*` scripts** that are no longer needed because their target
  upstream merged the fix.
- **Mixed `.mjs` + `.ts`** scripts with no clear rule for which to use.
- **Scripts that exist only to work around a transient install issue**
  that should now be permanent in `package.json` or `bunfig.toml`.

## Status legend

- `[ ]` pending — not yet read
- `[~]` reading — currently being audited
- `[!]` findings — audited, findings recorded, refactor pending
- `[*]` refactor — audited and edited (commit hash appended)
- `[x]` clean — audited, no changes warranted
- `[-]` delete — audited, slated for deletion (DELETED commit appended)
- `[?]` blocked — audited but blocked by lower-layer dependency

Findings format after path: `axis:short-note, axis:short-note`.

## Summary — Layer 0 audit findings

### Coverage

- **Audited:** 213/213 files. Zero files refactored — this is a findings-only pass.
- **Status mix:** ~165 `[x]` clean, ~32 `[-]` delete-recommended, ~16 `[!]` findings (verify/legacy).

### Top duplicate pairs and canonical-owner recommendations

The 10 same-named files between `scripts/` (root) and `eliza/packages/app-core/scripts/` are **NOT** simple duplicates. They split into two categories:

#### Category A — Thin proxy + extra work (2 files)

| File                                | Recommendation                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scripts/validate-cdn-assets.mjs`   | **Delete the proxy.** Replace package.json `cdn:validate` to call the app-core version via `run-eliza-app-core-script.mjs` (the proxy already exists for that). Currently it's a 21-line `spawnSync` to the canonical `eliza/packages/app-core/scripts/validate-cdn-assets.mjs`. Same redirect already happens for `clean`, `dev`, `start`, etc. |
| `scripts/copy-runtime-node-modules.ts` | **Keep root** — it's not a pure proxy. Root has 192 lines of pre-work (Bun-store symlink prep) before re-execing the app-core 1221-line copier. The naming is misleading (suggests proxy) but the body is real. Consider renaming to `scripts/prep-and-copy-runtime-node-modules.ts`. |

#### Category B — Diverged forks where root is canonical-for-Milady (8 files)

Each of these has a Milady-branded root copy (`MILADY_*` env vars, `milady-ai/milady` repo, imports `lib/eliza-package-mode.mjs`) and an upstream-elizaOS app-core copy (`ELIZA_*` env vars, `elizaos/eliza` repo, inline literals). Workflows + package.json call the **root** copy directly (e.g. `node scripts/init-submodules.mjs`). The app-core copy is the *upstream* version that ships when `@elizaos/app-core` is published as an npm package — it's unused inside this repo but must remain in the eliza submodule.

**Recommendation: leave both alone.** Touching either side could break either Milady CI or the published `@elizaos/app-core` package consumers. Mark `[!]` with `dedup:diverged-fork-leave-as-is`. The existence of these forks is a structural cost of the local-eliza-source pattern; consolidation would require coordinating with elizaOS upstream.

| Same-named file                       | Root caller(s)                              | App-core role                                   |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `init-submodules.mjs`                 | 9 workflows + postinstall                   | Upstream elizaOS copy (unused in this repo)     |
| `disable-local-eliza-workspace.mjs`   | 9 workflows + postinstall                   | Upstream elizaOS copy                           |
| `setup-upstreams.mjs`                 | `setup:upstreams` script + check-upstream-drift import | Upstream elizaOS copy                  |
| `check-upstream-drift.mjs`            | (zero direct callers — possibly dead)       | Upstream elizaOS copy                           |
| `run-production-build.mjs`            | `build` script + workflows                  | Upstream elizaOS copy                           |
| `run-release-contract-suite.mjs`      | `test:release:contract` script              | Upstream elizaOS copy (different test list)     |
| `write-build-info.ts`                 | (zero direct callers — possibly dead)       | Upstream elizaOS copy                           |
| `write-homepage-release-data.mjs`     | `build:web` script                          | Upstream elizaOS copy (different repo URL)      |
| `lib/repo-root.mjs`                   | Root + app-core scripts both import         | Has subrepo detection logic (different purpose) |
| `lib/sync-eliza-env-aliases.mjs`      | Root scripts (handles `MILADY_` prefix)     | Upstream elizaOS copy                           |

### Top deletion candidates (high confidence)

These have **zero callers** in `package.json`, `.github/workflows/`, or any other script. Verified by grep across the repo (excluding node_modules, eliza tree, dist):

1. `scripts/audit-actions.mjs` — orphan
2. `scripts/depot-ci-sync.mjs` — orphan
3. `scripts/dev-dutch.mjs` — orphan
4. `scripts/dev-dutch-pane.mjs` — orphan (only referenced by dev-dutch.mjs)
5. `scripts/run-live-scenarios.mjs` — orphan
6. `scripts/run-scenario-benchmark.mjs` — orphan
7. `scripts/run-scenarios-isolated.mjs` — orphan
8. `scripts/stochastic-report.mjs` — orphan
9. `scripts/sync-upstream-versions.mjs` — orphan
10. `scripts/update-eliza-submodule-pointers-to-remote.mjs` — orphan

Plus the **15 thin-proxy `scripts/miladyos/*.mjs`** wrappers — each is identical 28-line `spawnSync` to `eliza/packages/app-core/scripts/aosp/<name>.mjs`. Replace package.json `miladyos:*` scripts with `node scripts/run-eliza-app-core-script.mjs aosp/<name>.mjs` and delete the wrappers. Net: -15 files, +0 lines elsewhere.

### Patches that look obsolete vs still-needed

**The 7 root `patch-*` scripts cannot be verified from inside this repo** — verifying upstream-merged status requires checking the corresponding upstream package on npm/GitHub. Marked `[!] legacy:verify-upstream-merged`. The user should:

- `patch-elizacloud.mjs` — only listed in test contract, no actual postinstall hook found. Strongest deletion candidate among patches.
- `patch-coding-agent-adapters-tools-flag.mjs` — has its own test (`patch-coding-agent-adapters-tools-flag.test.ts`); check upstream `@elizaos/plugin-coding-agent-adapters` for the tools-flag fix.
- `patch-eliza-electrobun-windows-smoke-startup.mjs` — Windows-specific; check upstream electrobun.
- `patch-elizaos-app-core-mobile-package.mjs` / `patch-elizaos-capacitor-agent-package.mjs` / `patch-elizaos-package-esm-imports.mjs` / `patch-elizaos-package-styles.mjs` / `patch-elizaos-plugin-browser-bridge-package.mjs` — all referenced by `run-app-web-build.mjs` and/or `milady-postinstall-repo-setup.mjs`. Check each corresponding upstream package version for the fix.

`apply-eliza-ci-patches.mjs` and `repair-elizaos-package-links.mjs` are **active** (used by 6+ workflows), not patches in the same sense.

### `lib/*` modules — promote to a real package?

Both `scripts/lib/` (8 files) and `eliza/packages/app-core/scripts/lib/` (24 files) define small reusable primitives (port allocation, repo discovery, env aliases, version guards). The contents are intentionally script-side rather than runtime-side, but the **two `lib/` directories are themselves a duplication smell**:

- Root `scripts/lib/` is Milady-specific (handles `MILADY_*` env aliases, Milady repo paths).
- App-core `scripts/lib/` is the upstream elizaOS version published with `@elizaos/app-core`.

Promoting either to a real package wouldn't help — they exist in different distribution paths. Better target: collapse the **same-named** lib pairs (`repo-root.mjs`, `sync-eliza-env-aliases.mjs`) by pushing the Milady-specific differences upstream into elizaOS, then both copies could re-import from `@elizaos/app-core/scripts-lib`. **This is a coordination question, not a unilateral cleanup.**

### Risks / things that need user judgment before action

1. **The 8 diverged forks (Category B above)** look ripe for consolidation but are actually a structural artifact of the dual-mode (local/packages) eliza source setup. Touching them risks breaking either Milady CI (if you delete the root copy) or `@elizaos/app-core` npm consumers (if you delete the app-core copy). **Confirm with user before any action.**

2. **`scripts/check-upstream-drift.mjs` and `scripts/write-build-info.ts`** have zero direct callers in pkg/workflows but might be invoked dynamically by chained scripts or test contracts. Marked `[!]`, not `[-]`, until that is verified.

3. **The `miladyos/` proxy wrappers** could legitimately exist for `process.argv[1] === import.meta.url` entry-point gate reasons (the wrapper comment claims this). Verify that the `aosp/` scripts work without the wrapper before deleting. If the entry-point gate is real, the wrappers stay — but then the gate itself should be reviewed in app-core/scripts/aosp/ as a Layer-0 issue inside the eliza submodule.

4. **Test files under `scripts/`** (e.g. `ci-bootstrap-contract.test.ts`, `disable-local-eliza-workspace.test.ts`, `eliza-package-mode.test.ts`, `electrobun-runtime-root-contract.test.ts`, `patch-coding-agent-adapters-tools-flag.test.ts`, `release-workflow-contract.test.mjs`, `standalone-eliza-package-contract.test.ts`, `sync-eliza-env-aliases.test.ts`) were excluded from the 213-file count per AUDIT.md convention, but they pin behavior of root scripts. Any deletion of an audited script that is referenced by a `.test.ts` will break the test — verify before deleting.

5. **`scripts/lib/eliza-package-mode.mjs`** is the central source-mode router (`isLocalElizaDisabled()`, `getElizaosPackageSpecifier()`, etc.). It is not duplicated in app-core — it's purely Milady-side. Strong candidate to keep. Other root scripts depend on it; deleting it would cascade.

6. **Several `[x] clean`-marked app-core scripts are referenced only via the proxy `run-eliza-app-core-script.mjs`** — that's a valid invocation path but harder to grep for. Trust was extended based on (a) presence in `package.json` script names matching the file basename, or (b) workflow direct calls. Two scripts that did NOT show via either path were left as `[x]` because they are clearly part of internal app-core build chains imported by other app-core scripts (e.g. `runtime-package-manifest.ts`, `coverage-policy.mjs`, `dev-platform.mjs`).
