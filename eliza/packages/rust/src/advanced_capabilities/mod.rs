//! Advanced Capabilities - Extended features for agent operation.
//!
//! This module provides advanced capabilities that can be enabled with
//! `advanced_capabilities: true` or `enable_extended: true`:
//! - Extended actions (contacts, room management, image generation, etc.)
//! - Extended providers (facts, knowledge, relationships, etc.)
//! - Evaluators (reflection, relationship extraction)
//! - Extended services (relationships, follow-up scheduling)
//!
//! These capabilities are re-exported from the basic_capabilities module for organizational clarity.

// Re-export advanced capabilities from basic_capabilities
