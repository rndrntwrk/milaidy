		`(e.g. code written, PR created, tests passed) and is back at the idle prompt. ` +
		`Use this when the terminal output shows the task objectives have been met.\n\n` +

		`access to paths like /etc, ~/.ssh, ~/, /tmp, or any path that doesn't start with the working ` +
		`directory. Instead, respond with "n" (or the decline option) and tell the agent: ` +
		`"That path is outside your workspace. Use ${taskCtx.workdir} instead — ` +
		`create any files or directories you need there." This keeps the agent moving without ` +
		`granting out-of-scope access. The coordinator will also notify the human in case ` +
		`broader access was intended.\n` +
		`- For tool approval prompts (file writes, shell commands, etc.), respond "y" or use keys:["enter"] to approve.\n` +
		`- For Y/n confirmations that align with the original task, respond "y".\n` +
		`- For design questions or choices that could go either way, escalate.\n` +
		`- For error recovery prompts, try to respond if the path forward is clear.\n` +
		`- If the output shows a PR was just created (e.g. "Created pull request #N"), use "complete" — the task is done.\n` +
		`- If the agent is asking for information that was NOT provided in the original task ` +
		`(e.g. which repository to use, project requirements, credentials), ESCALATE. ` +
		`The coordinator does not have this information — the human must provide it.\n` +
		`- When in doubt, escalate — it's better to ask the human than to make a wrong choice.\n` +
		`- If the agent's output reveals a significant decision that sibling agents should know about ` +
		`(e.g. chose a library, designed an API shape, picked a UI pattern, established a writing style, ` +
		`narrowed a research scope, made any choice that affects the shared project), ` +

		`- When action is "respond", the "response" string is sent VERBATIM into the agent's terminal as if the user typed it.\n` +
		`- It MUST be a brief, second-person imperative addressed directly to the agent. Examples: "continue", "please create the pull request", "answer the question above", "proceed with the next step".\n` +
