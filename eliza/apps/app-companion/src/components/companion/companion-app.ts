/**
 * Companion App — @elizaos/app-companion
 *
 * Self-contained full-screen overlay app that renders a VRM avatar
 * with a chat dock. Implements the OverlayApp API so any similar
 * full-screen experience can follow the same pattern.
 *
 * Resources (VRM models, Three.js engine) load on mount and dispose
 * on unmount — nothing runs when the app is not active.
