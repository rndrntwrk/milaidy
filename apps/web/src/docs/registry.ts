/**
 * Docs registry — single source of truth for every consumer doc page at
 * milady.ai/docs. Drives the sidebar, tier landing pages, prev/next links,
 * and the /docs landing cards.
 *
 * Adding a page:
 *   1. Create the MDX file under `./content/<tier>/<slug>.mdx`
 *   2. Add an entry below with `component: lazy(() => import('./content/…'))`
 *   3. Bump the `order` field so the sidebar stays meaningfully ordered
 *
 * Pages that are planned but not yet written keep `component: null`. The
 * sidebar renders them as dimmed "Coming soon" items so the full info
 * architecture is visible from the first commit of Phase 2 onward. Later
 * phases flip null → lazy-loaded MDX as content lands.
