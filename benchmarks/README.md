# Milady Benchmarks

Automated evaluation suite for the Milady AI agent. Measures response quality across research and coding tasks using deterministic scoring (no LLM-based evaluation).

Scores are heuristic proxies based on keyword coverage and response structure. They are useful for regression tracking, not as a ground-truth correctness metric.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
bun run benchmark

# Research tasks only
bun run benchmark:research

# Coding tasks only
bun run benchmark:coding

# Single task
bun run benchmarks/run-benchmarks.ts --task research-001

# Dry run (show tasks without executing)
bun run benchmarks/run-benchmarks.ts --dry-run

# Server mode (boot runtime once, faster for full suite)
bun run benchmarks/run-benchmarks.ts --server
```

## Evaluating Results

After a benchmark run, evaluate the results:

```bash
# Evaluate the latest run
python3 benchmarks/evaluate.py benchmarks/results/latest/

# JSON output
python3 benchmarks/evaluate.py benchmarks/results/latest/ --format json

# Save to file
python3 benchmarks/evaluate.py benchmarks/results/latest/ -o report.json
```

## Task Format

Each task is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "research-001",
  "type": "research",
  "prompt": "The prompt sent to the agent",
  "expected_keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  "category": "research",
  "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
  "max_score": 10,
  "evaluation": {
    "criteria": [
      { "name": "accuracy", "weight": 0.3, "description": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Scoring

Scoring is deterministic and does not use LLM calls:

**Research tasks** are scored on:
- **Keyword coverage** — presence of expected terms in the response
- **Depth** — word count as a proxy for thoroughness
- **Structure** — headings, lists, code blocks, paragraph organization
- **Reasoning** — presence of analytical language (because, however, therefore, etc.)

**Coding tasks** are scored on:
- **Code presence** — code blocks or recognizable code patterns
- **Keyword coverage** — expected terms and concepts
- **TypeScript quality** — type annotations, generics, modern patterns
- **Completeness** — balanced braces, return statements, sufficient length
- **Explanation** — non-code text explaining the implementation

Each criterion is weighted according to the task's `evaluation.criteria` array. Final scores are on a 0-10 scale.

## Adding New Tasks

1. Add task definitions to `benchmarks/tasks/research-tasks.json` or `benchmarks/tasks/coding-tasks.json`
2. Follow the existing task format (id, type, prompt, expected_keywords, evaluation criteria)
3. Use unique IDs with the pattern `research-NNN` or `code-NNN`
4. Run `bun run benchmarks/run-benchmarks.ts --task <your-id>` to test

## Comparing Runs

Results are persisted per run in timestamped directories. To compare:

```bash
# Evaluate two different runs
python3 benchmarks/evaluate.py benchmarks/results/2026-03-29T12-00-00/ -o run1.json
python3 benchmarks/evaluate.py benchmarks/results/2026-03-30T12-00-00/ -o run2.json

# Compare overall scores
jq '.overall_score' run1.json run2.json
```

## CLI Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--type <t>` | Run only research or coding tasks | all |
| `--task <id>` | Run a single task by ID | all |
| `--dry-run` | Show tasks without running | false |
| `--server` | Server mode (boot once) | false |
| `--timeout <ms>` | Per-task timeout | 120000 |
| `--verbose` | Detailed output | false |

## Integration with elizaOS Benchmarks

The `milady-adapter.py` file integrates with the [elizaOS benchmarks](https://github.com/elizaOS/benchmarks) orchestrator. Set `MILADY_ROOT` to the repo root and place the adapter in the orchestrator's adapters directory.
