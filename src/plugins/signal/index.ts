/**
 * Milady Signal Plugin — Native Presage-based Signal integration.
 *
 * Uses QR-authenticated device linking (created via the pairing service)
 * to send and receive Signal messages through the elizaOS runtime.
 *
 * Loaded as `@milady/plugin-signal` via CHANNEL_PLUGIN_MAP when
 * `config.connectors.signal` is present.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * This plugin uses `@milady/signal-native`, a standalone Node.js Signal
 * client built on Presage (Rust) + napi-rs bindings — the "baileys for
 * Signal". No Docker, no Java, no signal-cli required.
 *
 * ## License
 *
 * Plugin code is MIT. The underlying `@milady/signal-native` library is
 * AGPL-3.0 (inherits from Presage). This plugin lazily imports it via
 * public API, maintaining license isolation.
