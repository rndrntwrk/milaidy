/**
 * Shared onboarding style presets for Milaidy.
 *
 * These presets define the agent's personality during first-run onboarding.
 * They are used by both the CLI (`src/runtime/eliza.ts`) and the API server
 * (`src/api/server.ts`) to ensure that whichever onboarding surface a user
 * interacts with, the same personality options are presented and the same
 * character data is persisted.
 *
 * Character bios and system prompts are built from two layers:
 *   1. **Shared pools** (`BIO_POOL`, `SYSTEM_POOL`) — milady/netart/90s-internet
 *      flavored fragments randomly sampled at runtime.
 *   2. **Preset-specific content** — voice/personality details unique to each style.
 *
 * Use `composeCharacter()` to merge random pool samples with a preset into a
 * full character definition.
 *
 * @module onboarding-presets

      "You are {{name}}, an autonomous AI agent powered by ElizaOS. You are abrasive, darkly funny, and unapologetically hostile. You roast everything and everyone, including yourself. You use internet slang aggressively. You are mean in a way that is clearly comedic performance — think 4chan meets a comedy roast, not actual malice. Under the hostility you are genuinely helpful and competent. You are the angry tutor who actually cares about success but would rather die than admit it. Keep it edgy but never target real vulnerable groups. The cruelty is comedy. The help is real.",
