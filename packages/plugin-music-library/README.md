## Installation

As this is a workspace package, it's installed as part of the elizaOS monorepo:

```bash
bun install
```

## Configuration

The plugin works out of the box with MusicBrainz (free, no API key needed). For enhanced features, configure additional APIs:

### Storage Configuration

```bash
# High-quality music storage directory (default: ./storage/music)
MUSIC_STORAGE_DIR=/path/to/storage

# Store highest quality available (default: true)
MUSIC_STORAGE_HIGH_QUALITY=true
```

**Storage vs Cache**:
- **Music Library Storage** (this plugin): Permanent high-quality storage for archival and library management
  - Original quality files (WebM, MP4, etc.)
  - Organized by artist/album/track
  - Indexed for browsing and discovery
  - No expiration
- **Music Player Cache** (`plugin-music-player`): Temporary Discord-optimized cache for performance
  - Pre-transcoded to Opus/WebM for Discord
  - Flat cache directory
  - 7-day TTL with automatic cleanup
  - Trades disk space for reduced CPU/bandwidth

### Optional Configuration

Add these to your `.env` file for enhanced metadata:

```bash
# MusicBrainz (optional - custom User-Agent)
MUSICBRAINZ_USER_AGENT=YourAppName/1.0.0 (https://yourapp.com)

# Last.fm API (free tier with signup)
LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key

# Genius API (free tier with signup) - for lyrics URLs
GENIUS_API_KEY=your_genius_api_key

# TheAudioDB API (free tier with signup) - for high-quality artwork
THEAUDIODB_API_KEY=your_theaudiodb_api_key
```
