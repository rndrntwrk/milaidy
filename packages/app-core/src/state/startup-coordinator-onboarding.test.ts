/**
 * Tests for onboarding completion flow through the StartupCoordinator.
 *
 * Replaces coverage from the deleted onboarding-finish-lock.test.ts.
 * The old tests verified the handoff overlay system which was removed.
 * These tests verify the coordinator-driven flow:
 *   onboarding-required → ONBOARDING_COMPLETE → starting-runtime → ready
