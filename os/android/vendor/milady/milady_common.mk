# Shared MiladyOS product layer.
#
# Per-target product makefiles (Cuttlefish, Pixel codenames) inherit from
# the matching device makefile first, then `inherit-product` this file.
# Anything that should hold for *every* MiladyOS image lands here.
#
# Invariants:
#   1. The Milady APK is installed as a privileged system app.
#   2. The privapp / default-permissions XMLs ship under /system/etc/.
#   3. Every stock app whose role we override is removed from
#      PRODUCT_PACKAGES so the resolver has a single answer for HOME,
#      DIALER, SMS, ASSISTANT, contacts, browser, calendar, camera,
#      gallery, music, deskclock, search.
#   4. First-boot setup wizard / provisioning is disabled — the device
#      must boot directly to Milady, not to a Google "Welcome" flow.
#   5. Brand properties land on /product/ where the product layer owns
#      them, not on /system.
