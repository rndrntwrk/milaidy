description: "Compile, sign, and distribute the Milady mobile app for iOS and Android."
---

The Milady mobile app (`apps/app`) is a Capacitor project that wraps the shared web UI in a native shell. Building it requires three steps: compiling the nine custom Capacitor plugins, bundling the Vite web assets, and syncing them into the native iOS or Android project. Distribution builds additionally require code signing — Apple certificates and provisioning profiles for iOS, a keystore for Android.

All build commands are invoked via `bun run` from inside the `apps/app` directory.

## Features

- Single-command builds for iOS (`build:ios`) and Android (`build:android`) that compile plugins, bundle assets, and sync to the native project in one step
- Separate plugin build step (`plugin:build`) for faster iteration when only plugin code has changed
- Capacitor sync commands to push already-built web assets to native projects without a full rebuild
- Live reload support by pointing the Capacitor server config at a local Vite dev server
- Xcode and Android Studio integration via `cap:open:ios` and `cap:open:android`

## Configuration

**Prerequisites by platform:**

| Requirement | iOS | Android |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| Operating system | macOS only | macOS, Linux, or Windows |
| IDE | Xcode 15+ | Android Studio (recent) |
| SDK | iOS platform tools via Xcode | Android SDK API 35 via SDK Manager |
| Dependency manager | CocoaPods (`sudo gem install cocoapods`) | JDK 17+ (bundled with Android Studio) |
| Apple Developer account | Required for device/distribution builds | — |
| Keystore file | — | Required for release APK/AAB signing |

**Build commands:**

```bash
# From apps/app — build everything and sync to iOS
bun run build:ios

# Build everything and sync to Android
bun run build:android

# Build all nine custom Capacitor plugins only
bun run plugin:build

# Push already-built web assets to both native projects
bun run cap:sync

# Open native project in IDE
bun run cap:open:ios      # Xcode
bun run cap:open:android  # Android Studio
```

**iOS signing:** Open `apps/app/ios/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode, select the App target, go to Signing & Capabilities, and choose your development team. For App Store distribution, select a distribution certificate and a matching provisioning profile.

**Android signing:** Create a release keystore and configure it in `apps/app/android/app/build.gradle` under `signingConfigs`. Use `./gradlew bundleRelease` (AAB for Play Store) or `./gradlew assembleRelease` (APK for direct distribution) from the `android/` directory.

## iOS Runtime Modes

The iOS bundle supports three runtime modes. Use the root helper scripts so the Vite environment, native sync, CocoaPods, and Xcode project overlay stay aligned.

The iOS target is one app. The first onboarding screen chooses the connection mode:
remote Mac, Eliza Cloud, or Eliza Cloud plus donated phone compute. The mode-specific
commands below only pre-seed development builds so Xcode opens with the expected
defaults; users can still change the connection mode in onboarding.

### 1. Phone build connected to this Mac

Expose the Milady API on the Mac's LAN address, then build/open the iOS project with the phone pointed at that API:

```bash
MILADY_API_BIND=0.0.0.0 \
MILADY_API_TOKEN=replace-with-a-short-lived-token \
MILADY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=capacitor://localhost,ionic://localhost \
bun run dev

MILADY_IOS_REMOTE_API_BASE=http://192.168.1.42:31337 \
MILADY_IOS_REMOTE_API_TOKEN=replace-with-the-same-token \
bun run dev:ios:remote-mac
```

If `MILADY_IOS_REMOTE_API_BASE` is omitted, the helper picks the first non-loopback IPv4 address and port `31337`. Run from Xcode with an Apple development team selected to install on a physical phone.

### 2. Phone build running in cloud

Build the bundled iOS shell with the cloud runtime defaults, then select Eliza Cloud
in the first onboarding view:

```bash
bun run dev:ios:cloud
```

Set `MILADY_IOS_CLOUD_BASE` or `VITE_ELIZA_CLOUD_BASE` only when targeting a non-default Eliza Cloud environment.

### 3. Cloud runtime plus donated phone compute

Cloud-hybrid mode keeps the app on the cloud runtime and starts the existing device bridge so eligible local-inference work can route to the phone through the server-side routing preferences. Select the Cloud + phone compute option in the first onboarding view.

```bash
ELIZA_DEVICE_BRIDGE_ENABLED=1 \
ELIZA_DEVICE_PAIRING_TOKEN=replace-with-a-short-lived-token \
bun run dev

MILADY_IOS_DEVICE_BRIDGE_API_BASE=https://agent-or-tunnel.example.com \
MILADY_IOS_DEVICE_BRIDGE_TOKEN=replace-with-the-same-token \
bun run dev:ios:cloud-hybrid
```

`MILADY_IOS_DEVICE_BRIDGE_API_BASE` derives `wss://.../api/local-inference/device-bridge`. Use `MILADY_IOS_DEVICE_BRIDGE_URL` when the bridge lives at a different URL. The server still decides which slots use the paired device through Local models routing; the phone does not override cloud routing on its own.

<Warning>
Build-time API and bridge tokens are embedded in the web bundle. Use short-lived development or TestFlight credentials, not long-lived production secrets.
</Warning>

## Live Reload Development

Live reload lets you see web-layer changes on a physical device or simulator without rebuilding native code. Capacitor achieves this by loading the app from your local Vite dev server instead of the bundled assets.

**Setup:**

1. Find your machine's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.42`). On macOS, check System Settings → Wi-Fi → Details → IP Address, or run `ipconfig getifaddr en0`.

2. Edit `apps/app/capacitor.config.ts` and add a `server` block pointing at the Vite dev server. This repo's Vite UI defaults to port `2138` (or `MILADY_PORT` if you override it), not Vite's stock `5173`:

```typescript
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  // ...existing config
  server: {
    url: "http://192.168.1.42:2138",
    cleartext: true, // required for plain HTTP on Android
  },
};
```

3. Start the Vite dev server from the web project root:

```bash
bun run dev
```

4. Sync and launch on device:

```bash
bun run cap:sync
bun run cap:open:ios    # or cap:open:android
```

5. Run the app from Xcode or Android Studio. The app loads from Vite, and edits to web code hot-reload instantly.

<Warning>
Remove the `server` override from `capacitor.config.ts` before building for distribution. Shipping a release build that points at `localhost` will show a blank screen for end users.
</Warning>

## iOS Build Walkthrough

**Step-by-step debug build:**

1. Compile plugins, bundle web assets, and sync to the iOS project:

```bash
bun run build:ios
```

2. Open the workspace in Xcode:

```bash
open apps/app/ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

3. In Xcode, select the **App** target, go to **Signing & Capabilities**, and choose your development team.

4. Select your target device or simulator from the device toolbar.

5. Press **Cmd+R** (Product → Run) to build and launch a debug build.

**Distribution via TestFlight:**

1. In Xcode, select **Product → Archive**. Wait for the archive to build.
2. When the Organizer window opens, select the archive and click **Distribute App**.
3. Choose **App Store Connect** → **Upload**.
4. Follow the prompts to select your distribution certificate and provisioning profile.
5. Once uploaded, the build appears in App Store Connect under the TestFlight tab after processing (usually 10-30 minutes).

**Common issue — "No signing certificate":**

This means Xcode cannot find a valid development or distribution certificate. Fix it by navigating to **Xcode → Settings → Accounts**, selecting your Apple ID, clicking your team, then **Manage Certificates**. Click the **+** button to create a new Apple Development certificate. For distribution, create an Apple Distribution certificate through the Apple Developer portal.

## Android Build Walkthrough

**Step-by-step debug build:**

1. Compile plugins, bundle web assets, and sync to the Android project:

```bash
bun run build:android
```

2. Open the Android project in Android Studio:

```bash
# Or use the helper:
bun run cap:open:android
```

3. Wait for Gradle sync to complete. Android Studio will download dependencies and index the project. This can take several minutes on first open.

4. Select your target device or emulator from the device dropdown in the toolbar.

5. Click **Run → Run 'app'** (or press Shift+F10) to install and launch a debug build.

**Release builds:**

For Google Play Store distribution (AAB format):

```bash
cd apps/app/android && ./gradlew bundleRelease
```

For direct distribution (APK format):

```bash
cd apps/app/android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Release signing setup:**

1. Generate a keystore:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -alias milady -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

2. Configure the keystore in `apps/app/android/app/build.gradle` under `signingConfigs`:

```groovy
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file("release.keystore")
            storePassword "your-store-password"
            keyAlias "milady"
            keyPassword "your-key-password"
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

<Warning>
Never commit keystore files or passwords to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager to inject them at build time.
</Warning>

## CI/CD Considerations

Automated builds for both platforms can run in headless environments without opening an IDE.

**iOS (macOS CI runners only):**

```bash
xcodebuild -workspace ios/App/App.xcworkspace \
  -scheme App \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath build/App.xcarchive \
  archive
```

Export the archive with an `ExportOptions.plist` that specifies your distribution method and provisioning profile.

**Android:**

```bash
cd apps/app/android && ./gradlew bundleRelease --no-daemon
```

The `--no-daemon` flag ensures Gradle does not leave background processes on ephemeral CI runners.

**Secrets management:**

- Store iOS signing certificates and provisioning profiles as base64-encoded CI secrets. Decode and install them into a temporary keychain before the build.
- Store the Android keystore file and its passwords as CI secrets. Reference them via environment variables in `build.gradle`.
- Both platforms benefit from caching dependency directories (CocoaPods for iOS, Gradle for Android) to speed up subsequent builds.

## Troubleshooting

**"Pod install failed"**

CocoaPods cannot resolve dependencies, often due to a stale spec repo. Run:

```bash
cd apps/app/ios/App && pod install --repo-update
```

If the issue persists, delete `Podfile.lock` and the `Pods/` directory, then run `pod install` again.

**"Android SDK not found"**

The build cannot locate the Android SDK. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable:

```bash
# macOS / Linux (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH"
```

Then restart your terminal and retry the build.

**"Plugin build failed"**

One or more of the nine custom Capacitor plugin TypeScript sources failed to compile. Isolate the error by building plugins separately:

```bash
bun run plugin:build
```

Review the TypeScript compiler output to identify which plugin has the error. Fix the TypeScript issue, then re-run the full build.

**"White screen on device"**

The native shell launched but no web content is visible. This usually means web assets were not synced to the native project. Run:

```bash
bun run cap:sync
```

Then rebuild and re-run from the IDE. Also verify that the `server` override in `capacitor.config.ts` is removed if you previously used live reload.

**"Permission denied" on macOS**

macOS quarantine flags can prevent Xcode from accessing iOS project files downloaded or generated by tools. Clear them:

```bash
xattr -cr apps/app/ios/
```

Then re-open the workspace in Xcode.
