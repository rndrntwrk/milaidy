---

**Milady** is a local-first AI assistant built on [ElizaOS](https://github.com/elizaOS). It runs entirely on your machine -- not in a datacenter, not in the cloud. It manages your sessions, tools, and agent personality through a Gateway control plane, connects to Telegram, Discord, and other platforms, and ships with a web dashboard for real-time interaction.

It supports 11 model providers out of the box (including fully local inference via Ollama), has a growing plugin ecosystem powered by ElizaOS, a skills marketplace via [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai), and runs on every major platform: desktop, mobile, web, CLI, and Chrome extension.

## Why Milady

### Local-First Privacy

Milady runs on your hardware. Your conversations, memory, and wallet keys stay in `~/.milady/` on your local filesystem. Nothing leaves your machine unless you explicitly connect an external service. Even embedding generation can run locally via the `plugin-local-embedding` package.

### Multi-Model, Multi-Provider

Connect to any of 11 supported AI providers -- or run fully offline with Ollama:

| Provider | What You Get |
|----------|-------------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude (recommended) |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, o1, and friends |
| **OpenRouter** | 100+ models through one API |
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini Pro and Ultra |
| **xAI** | Grok |
| **Groq** | Ultra-fast inference |
| **DeepSeek** | Reasoning models |
| **Mistral** | Open-weight European models |
| **Together AI** | Open-source model hosting |
| **Vercel AI Gateway** | Unified gateway access |
| **Ollama** | Fully local, free, no API key |

Switch providers mid-conversation with `/model <id>`. No lock-in.

### Plugin Ecosystem

Milady ships with 25+ first-party ElizaOS plugins covering knowledge management, browser automation, computer use, Discord, Telegram, TTS (Edge TTS and ElevenLabs), PDF processing, shell access, cron scheduling, trust scoring, and more. Third-party plugins install with a single command through the plugin manager.

### Skills Marketplace

Skills are markdown-based extensions that teach your agent new capabilities without writing code. Browse and install skills from [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai), the default skills registry, or point to your own registry.

### Autonomous Mode

Milady can operate autonomously -- executing scheduled tasks, running multi-step workflows, and maintaining its own loop of thoughts and actions. Configure triggers (interval, cron, or one-shot) and let the agent work on your behalf.

### Built-In Crypto Wallet

The onboarding flow can generate or import EVM and Solana wallets. Keys are stored locally in your config and available to plugins at runtime for on-chain interactions, trading, and DeFi.

## Platform Support

Milady is a single codebase that targets every surface you need:

## Architecture at a Glance

Milady is structured as a layered system:

```
 User Interfaces (Desktop / Mobile / Web / CLI / TUI)
                         |
                    API Server (HTTP + WebSocket on :2138)
                         |
                   Gateway (:18789)
                         |
                  ElizaOS Runtime
                    |         |
            Milady Plugin    Other Plugins
            (personality,     (knowledge, browser,
             wallet, skills,   TTS, Discord, Telegram,
             autonomous state) shell, cron, ...)
                    |
              Connector Layer
         (Telegram, Discord, WebChat, ...)
```

- **ElizaOS Runtime** -- the core agent framework that handles memory, message processing, action dispatch, and provider abstraction.
- **Milady Plugin** -- a first-party ElizaOS plugin that provides workspace context, session keys, personality presets, autonomous state, and wallet integration.
- **Gateway** -- a WebSocket + HTTP multiplexed server that bridges the runtime to all connected clients and connectors.
- **Plugin System** -- standard ElizaOS plugins that add capabilities (knowledge, browser, TTS, etc.).
- **Connector Layer** -- platform-specific adapters for Telegram, Discord, and the web chat UI.

All configuration lives in `~/.milady/milady.json`. Secrets can go in `~/.milady/.env`.

<Info>
Milady is currently in alpha (`v2.0.0-alpha.26`). APIs and configuration may change between releases. Check the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases) for the latest version.
