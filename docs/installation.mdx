## Prerequisites

Before installing Milady, make sure you have the required runtime:

| Requirement | Version | How to Check | Install |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Node.js** | >= 22 | `node --version` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or `nvm install 22` |

For **building from source** or development, you also need:

| Requirement | Version | How to Check | Install |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Bun** | latest | `bun --version` | `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash` |

<Info>
Node 22+ is required because Milady uses native ES modules, the `node:` protocol prefix, and other modern Node APIs. Bun is only needed for development and building from source -- it is used as the package manager and script runner. The published npm package and install scripts run on Node.js alone.
</Info>

You will also need an API key from at least one model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.) -- unless you plan to use [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for fully local inference, which requires no API key.

## Desktop App (Recommended)

The desktop app is the easiest way to get started. It packages the full Milady runtime, web dashboard, and gateway into a native Electron application with auto-updates and system tray integration.

Download from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest)**:

| Platform | File | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | [`Milady-arm64.dmg`](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest) | M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs |
| macOS (Intel) | [`Milady-x64.dmg`](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest) | Pre-2020 Macs |
| Windows | [`Milady-Setup.exe`](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest) | Windows 10+ |
| Linux | [`Milady.AppImage`](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest) / [`.deb`](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest) | AppImage or Debian package |

All releases are signed and notarized. No Gatekeeper warnings on macOS.

### Verify Download Integrity

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS.txt
shasum -a 256 --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS.txt
```

## CLI Install

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    The install script downloads the latest release, places the binary in your PATH, and runs initial setup:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://milady-ai.github.io/milady/install.sh | bash
    milady setup
    ```

    Then start Milady:

    ```bash
    milady
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">
    ```powershell
    irm https://milady-ai.github.io/milady/install.ps1 | iex
    ```

    After installation, open a new terminal window and run:

    ```powershell
    milady setup
    milady
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
    If you prefer npm/npx:

    ```bash
    npm install -g milaidy
    milady setup
    milady
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Build from Source

For contributors or anyone who wants the latest development version:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/milady-ai/milady.git
    cd milady
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

    The `postinstall` script automatically initializes git submodules, ensures the skills directory exists, links the browser server, and patches dependencies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build everything">
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

    This compiles the TypeScript source with `tsdown`, writes build info, and builds the web app in `apps/app`.

    <Info>
    If you want to build without Bun as the runtime (Node only): `bun run build:node` uses `node --import tsx` instead of Bun for script execution.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Milady">
    ```bash
    bun run start
    ```

    This launches the gateway and API server. On first run, you will be walked through the interactive onboarding flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development Mode

Milady has several development modes depending on what you are working on:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Full dev (runtime + UI hot reload)
bun run dev
```

```bash UI only (web dashboard hot reload)
bun run dev:ui
```

```bash Desktop app (Electron with live reload)
bun run dev:desktop
```

```bash TUI (terminal interface)
bun run tui
```

```bash TUI with dev profile (port 19001)
bun run tui:dev
```

```bash All services simultaneously
bun run dev:all
```
</CodeGroup>

The `dev` script uses `scripts/dev-ui.mjs` to start the runtime with hot-reload for both the backend and the web UI. The `dev:desktop` script starts the Electron app with live reload from `apps/app/electron`.

## Mobile Builds

Milady uses [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) to target Android and iOS:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Android">
    ```bash
    bun run build:android
    ```

    For development with live reload:

    ```bash
    bun run dev:android
    ```

    Requires Android Studio and the Android SDK.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="iOS">
    ```bash
    bun run build:ios
    ```

    For development with live reload:

    ```bash
    bun run dev:ios
    ```

    Requires Xcode and a Mac.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Environment Setup

Milady stores all state in `~/.milady/` by default. The onboarding wizard handles initial configuration, but you can also set environment variables directly.

### API Keys

Set at least one model provider key. You can do this via the onboarding wizard, in `~/.milady/milady.json` under the `env` field, or in `~/.milady/.env`:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Anthropic (recommended)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

```bash OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

```bash OpenRouter
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-..."
```

```bash Google Gemini
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="AI..."
```

```bash Ollama (local, no key needed)
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Ports

| Service | Default Port | Environment Variable |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Dashboard (Web UI) | `2138` | `MILADY_PORT` |
| Gateway (API + WebSocket) | `18789` | `MILADY_GATEWAY_PORT` |

```bash
# Example: custom ports
MILADY_PORT=3000 MILADY_GATEWAY_PORT=19000 milady start
```

### State Directory

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MILADY_STATE_DIR` | `~/.milady` | Root directory for all Milady state |
| `MILADY_CONFIG_PATH` | `~/.milady/milady.json` | Explicit config file path |

## Security: API Token

The API server binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) by default -- only your local machine can reach it. If you expose the server to the network (e.g., `MILADY_API_BIND=0.0.0.0` for container or cloud deployments), you **must** set an authentication token:

```bash
echo "MILADY_API_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> ~/.milady/.env
```

<Warning>
Without a token on a public bind address, anyone who can reach the server gets full access to the dashboard, agent endpoints, and wallet operations.
</Warning>

## Verify Installation

After installation, confirm everything is working:

```bash
# Check version
milady --version

# Show configured model providers
milady models

# Run the interactive setup wizard
milady setup
```

The `models` command lists all configured model providers and their status. The `setup` command runs the onboarding wizard if needed and validates your workspace.

<Info>
A `milady doctor` diagnostic command is planned but not yet implemented. See [milady doctor](/cli/doctor) for the planned behavior.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

### Node version too old

```
Error: Milady requires Node.js >= 22
```

Upgrade Node.js: `nvm install 22 && nvm use 22`, or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### Bun not found

```
Error: bun: command not found
```

Install Bun:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` / `source ~/.zshrc`.

### Port already in use

```
Error: EADDRINUSE :::2138
```

Another process is using the default port. Either stop it or use a different port:
```bash
MILADY_PORT=3000 milady start
```

### Permission denied on install script

```bash
chmod +x ~/.milady/bin/milady
```

### PGLite / database corruption

If you see database errors on startup, Milady will attempt automatic recovery. If that fails, you can reset the database:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.milady/workspace/.eliza/.elizadb
milady start
```

<Warning>
Deleting the database directory removes all conversation history and memory. Use this as a last resort.
</Warning>

### macOS Gatekeeper blocks the app

The desktop app is signed and notarized. If Gatekeeper still blocks it:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Milady.app
```
