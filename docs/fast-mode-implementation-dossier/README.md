# Fast Mode Implementation Dossier

This dossier is a deep implementation and risk analysis for adding **per-message fast mode** to Milady + ElizaOS while preserving autonomous/full mode behavior.

The goal is not just a feature spec. It is an execution blueprint:

- exact control-flow mapping of current behavior
- phase-by-phase implementation with file-level changes
- critical teardown of the prior recommendation
- alternatives, weaknesses, and failure modes
- rollout/rollback, observability, and testing requirements

## Grounding Scope

This dossier is based on direct code-path inspection across:

- Milady frontend:
  - `apps/app/src/components/ChatView.tsx`
  - `apps/app/src/hooks/useVoiceChat.ts`
  - `apps/app/src/AppContext.tsx`
  - `apps/app/src/api-client.ts`
- Milady API and cloud bridge:
  - `src/api/server.ts`
  - `src/cloud/cloud-proxy.ts`
  - `src/cloud/bridge-client.ts`
  - `deploy/cloud-agent-entrypoint.ts`
- Milady runtime bootstrapping:
  - `src/runtime/eliza.ts`
  - `src/runtime/milady-plugin.ts`
  - `src/providers/workspace-provider.ts`
- Eliza core runtime and message pipeline:
  - `eliza/packages/typescript/src/services/message.ts`
  - `eliza/packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts`
  - `eliza/packages/typescript/src/services/action-filter.ts`
  - `eliza/packages/typescript/src/types/message-service.ts`
  - `eliza/packages/typescript/src/types/components.ts`
  - `eliza/packages/typescript/src/types/model.ts`
  - `eliza/packages/typescript/src/autonomy/service.ts`
  - `eliza/packages/typescript/src/request-context.ts`

## Executive Recommendation (High Level)

After validating real control flow and runtime constraints, the recommended implementation is:

1. **Stage A (safe, quick):** add end-to-end `fastMode` request contract and carry it through Milady local + cloud paths.
2. **Stage B (core correctness):** add first-class per-message processing controls in Eliza MessageService and runtime (not runtime-global mutation).
3. **Stage C (optimization):** introduce deterministic provider/action/evaluator fast profiles.
4. **Stage D (production hardening):** add observability, test gating, and canary rollout.

The details, caveats, and critical weaknesses of alternative paths are documented in the files below.
