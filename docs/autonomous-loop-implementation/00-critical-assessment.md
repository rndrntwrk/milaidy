# Critical Assessment of the Initial Plan

This document is intentionally critical. It identifies where the earlier phase plan was correct, where it was incomplete, and where it could fail in production.

## Executive Critique

The initial 8-phase plan had the right directional goals, but it had major gaps:

1. **No event contract design**
   - "Stream events over websocket" was proposed without defining schema versioning, ordering guarantees, dedupe, replay, or compatibility strategy.
   - Without this, frontend and backend can drift quickly.

2. **No control-flow proof for autonomy events**
   - It assumed all meaningful autonomy internals are emitted in structured form.
   - In reality, some detail is currently only available in logs and message content, not always as normalized event payloads.

3. **Admin identity semantics were underspecified**
   - "Set user as admin during onboarding" ignored existing `ownership.ownerId` conventions and role providers in Eliza core.
   - It did not define migration behavior for already-created worlds/rooms.

4. **No context budget and anti-bloat design**
   - "Blend admin chat with autonomous context" was directionally right, but lacked strict token budget policy, summarization boundaries, and source precedence.
   - This can cause runaway context growth and degraded model behavior.

5. **Rolodex trust policy lacked threat model**
   - "Trust admin claims" is useful UX but dangerous if identity linkage is weak.
   - No policy was defined for replay attacks, account hijack, or stale role state.

6. **UI plan lacked performance constraints**
   - "Show all actions/thoughts/providers/evaluators" can flood the DOM in active loops.
   - No approach was defined for windowing, event compaction, or high-frequency rendering.

7. **No phased rollout controls**
   - The initial plan assumed one-way implementation.
   - It lacked feature flags, canary rollout, and kill-switch strategy.

8. **No testing depth**
   - Required integration and reliability tests were not scoped (ordering, reconnect, replay, role migration, fallback paths).

## What the Current Code Actually Does (Critical Reality Check)

## 1) Websocket path is minimal and status-only

In `src/api/server.ts`, websocket currently:

- accepts `/ws` upgrades
- tracks connected clients
- sends initial `{ type: "status", ... }`
- responds to `"ping"` with `"pong"`
- broadcasts status every 5 seconds

It does **not** stream:

- message-level lifecycle
- action/evaluator/provider events
- autonomous internal events
- logs as structured websocket events

Implication: autonomy observability cannot be delivered by frontend work alone.

## 2) Conversation identity is ephemeral and singleton

Current chat identity (`state.chatUserId`) is generated server-side and kept in-memory, with ownership metadata set to that UUID. There is no persistent "admin entity" identity model in Milady API state.

Implication: trust semantics tied to role are fragile until identity is formalized.

## 3) Workbench autonomy status is synthetic

`/api/workbench/overview` returns:

- `autonomy.enabled = true`
- `autonomy.thinking = false`

This is currently static placeholder state, not derived from actual AutonomyService internals.

Implication: existing UI autonomy indicators can be misleading.

## 4) Frontend only consumes websocket `status`

`apps/app/src/AppContext.tsx` currently wires:

- `client.connectWs()`
- `client.onWsEvent("status", ...)`

No event pipeline exists for structured autonomy stream data.

## 5) Logs are pull-based, not push-based

`LogsView` uses `loadLogs()` via `/api/logs`. This is request/refresh-driven, not real-time stream-driven.

Implication: "live autonomy loop" UI cannot be achieved with low latency unless event push is added.

## 6) Runtime ownership metadata exists, roles metadata does not

Milady writes `world.metadata.ownership.ownerId` in multiple places (CLI and API room setup). It does not consistently initialize/populate `world.metadata.roles`.

Eliza role provider logic expects role metadata for hierarchy.

Implication: owner/admin semantics are partially present but not complete.

## 7) Rolodex plugin is listed, not guaranteed active

`plugins.json` includes `@elizaos/plugin-rolodex`, but Milady default plugin loading is auto-detected + allowlist/entries driven. Rolodex is not guaranteed loaded unless configured.

Implication: trust behavior depending on rolodex requires explicit enable/load policy.

## Where the Earlier Plan Was Correct

- Prioritizing event streaming first is correct.
- Building a dedicated autonomous panel instead of burying detail in logs is correct.
- Defining owner/admin trust semantics early is correct.
- Integrating admin chat context into autonomy loop is correct if bounded.
- Using old dashboard concepts (thought feed, action list, live indicator) is directionally strong.

## Core Design Corrections Required

1. **Define a versioned event contract first**
   - Add `version`, `eventId`, `runId`, `seq`, `ts`, `stream`, `payload`.
   - Define ordering + dedupe semantics before coding UI.

2. **Add bounded replay buffer on server**
   - Frontend reconnects must recover missing events (`sinceEventId` / `sinceTs`).
   - Prevent state divergence after reconnect.

3. **Create explicit AdminIdentity model in API state**
   - Persist admin entity id and world binding in config/state.
   - Migrate old worlds with ownership-only metadata.

4. **Define strict context blending policy**
   - Use summaries + recency windows.
   - Hard token caps per source.
   - Deterministic truncation and priority.

5. **Define trust policy with guardrails**
   - Role-gated trust acceptance.
   - Audit trail for accepted claims.
   - Re-check role at action time (not only session start).

6. **Design UI for event velocity**
   - Event windowing, grouping, compaction.
   - Pause/resume live scroll.
   - Keep high-frequency updates performant.

7. **Roll out behind flags**
   - `AUTONOMY_EVENT_STREAM_ENABLED`
   - `AUTONOMY_PANEL_ENABLED`
   - `ADMIN_TRUST_MODE_ENABLED`

## Critical Open Questions

These must be resolved before implementation begins:

1. Should autonomy panel show raw model reasoning text or only sanitized event summaries?
2. Should admin chat always be included in autonomy context, or only recent summary memory?
3. Which room is canonical "admin chat" if multiple conversations exist?
4. Should owner role be global per agent or per world?
5. How much event history should be replayable on reconnect?
6. Is rolodex trust global or scoped to specific claim categories (social handles, phone, wallet)?

## Bottom Line

The initial plan was useful as a high-level roadmap, but not implementation-safe. This dossier corrects that by:

- proving current control flow from real code paths,
- defining contracts and invariants explicitly,
- enumerating alternatives and tradeoffs,
- and adding migration, rollout, and failure handling that were previously missing.
