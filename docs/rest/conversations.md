---

The conversations API manages the agent's web-chat interface. Each conversation has its own room in the runtime's memory system, allowing independent message histories. The API supports both streaming (SSE) and synchronous message delivery.

## Endpoints

| GET | `/api/conversations` | List all conversations |
| POST | `/api/conversations` | Create a new conversation |
| GET | `/api/conversations/:id/messages` | Get messages for a conversation |
| POST | `/api/conversations/:id/messages` | Send a message (synchronous) |
| POST | `/api/conversations/:id/messages/stream` | Send a message (SSE streaming) |
| POST | `/api/conversations/:id/messages/truncate` | Truncate messages from a point |

Send a message and get the agent's response synchronously (non-streaming).

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | Yes | User message text |
| `channelType` | string | No | Channel type override |
| `images` | array | No | Attached image data (`[{ data, mimeType }]`) |
| `conversationMode` | string | No | `"simple"` or `"power"` |

  "agentName": "Milady"
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | Condition |

| 404 | Conversation not found |
| 503 | Agent is not running |

---

### POST /api/conversations/:id/messages/stream

Send a message and receive the agent's response via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Each token is streamed as it is generated, followed by a final `done` event.

**Request Body**

Same as `POST /api/conversations/:id/messages`.

**SSE Events**

Token events (append semantics — each text chunk extends the reply):
```
data: {"type":"token","text":"Here's"}
data: {"type":"token","text":" what"}
data: {"type":"token","text":" I think..."}
```

Snapshot events (replace semantics — used when action callbacks update the reply in-place):
```
data: {"type":"token","fullText":"Here's what I think...\n\nSearching for track..."}
```

When a `fullText` field is present, it is authoritative and the client should replace the entire assistant message text rather than appending.

Final event:
```
data: {"type":"done","fullText":"Here's what I think...","agentName":"Milady"}
```

The conversation title is auto-generated in the background if it is still `"New Chat"`, and a `conversation-updated` WebSocket event is broadcast. If AI title generation fails, the title falls back to the first five words of the user's message.

<Info>
Action callbacks (e.g. from music playback, wallet flows) use **replace** semantics by default: each successive callback replaces the callback portion of the message rather than appending. Callbacks can optionally set `merge: "append"` or `merge: "replace"` on the callback content when a plugin needs to override that default. See [Action callbacks and SSE streaming](/runtime/action-callback-streaming) for details.
</Info>

**Error recovery**

If the model provider fails **after** tokens have already been streamed to the client, the server preserves the streamed text. The `done` event's `fullText` contains the text that was already delivered rather than a generic error message. This prevents the client from losing a partially complete reply.

If the failure occurs **before** any text is streamed, the `done` event's `fullText` contains a fallback error description (e.g. provider connectivity issue) so the user still receives feedback.

In both cases, an `error` SSE event may also be emitted if the reply cannot be persisted:

```
data: {"type":"error","message":"Failed to persist message"}
```

### POST /api/conversations/:id/messages/truncate

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `messageId` | string | Yes | ID of the message to truncate from |

### POST /api/conversations/:id/greeting

{
  "text": "gm. ready to go viral today or what.",
  "agentName": "Milady",
  "generated": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
