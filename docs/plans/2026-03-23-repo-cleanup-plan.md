# 2026-03-23 Repository Cleanup Plan

## Baseline

- `knip`
  - 212 unused files
  - 61 unused dependencies
  - 149 unused exported types
  - 2 duplicate exports
- `madge`
  - `packages/agent/src/index.ts`: 0 cycles
  - `packages/app-core/src/index.ts`: 0 cycles
  - `packages/ui/src/index.ts`: 0 cycles
- `scripts/type-audit.mjs --json`
  - 2,498 type definitions
  - 2,315 exact or subset/superset structural overlaps
- Re-export and boundary scan
  - 110 pure re-export files
  - 72 cross-package re-export bridge files
  - 212 package-boundary violations before manifest fixes

## Current After Pass 1

- `knip`
  - 0 unused files
  - 84 unused exported types
  - 133 dependency-related findings remaining
- `madge`
  - `packages/agent/src/index.ts`: 0 cycles
  - `packages/app-core/src/index.ts`: 0 cycles
  - `packages/ui/src/index.ts`: 0 cycles
- `scripts/find-collisions.mjs --json`
  - 956 scanned files
  - 6,544 tracked symbols
  - 114 pure re-export files
  - 75 cross-package re-export bridge files
  - 0 package-boundary violations
  - 141 exported function collisions
  - 102 exported interface collisions
  - 197 exported type collisions
- Verification
  - `bun run check`: passed
  - `bun run build`: passed
  - Focused smoke tests: 64 unit tests passed
  - Focused e2e smoke: 3 tests passed
  - `bun run test` and the full `bun run test:e2e` entrypoints still need a clean non-hanging completion; Vitest workers linger and leave orphan processes in this environment

## Phase 1

- [x] Run `knip`, `madge`, and the existing collision/type audits.
- [x] Capture the cleanup backlog in a tracked plan.
- [x] Replace the old collision script with an AST-based audit that reports:
  - class name collisions
  - exported function name collisions
  - local interface collisions
  - exported interface collisions
  - local type alias collisions
  - exported type alias collisions
  - pure re-export files
  - package-boundary violations

## Phase 2

- [x] Consolidate exact duplicate `agent` and `shared` contract sources:
  - `packages/agent/src/contracts/apps.ts`
  - `packages/agent/src/contracts/permissions.ts`
  - `packages/agent/src/contracts/wallet.ts`
  - `packages/agent/src/utils/spoken-text.ts`
- [x] Re-run lint, build, and typecheck.
- [ ] Re-run the full unit and e2e entrypoints without the current Vitest hang.

## Phase 3

- [x] Fix package hierarchy drift.
- [x] Start with manifest-level correctness:
  - `packages/app-core/package.json` currently imports `@elizaos/agent` throughout source but does not declare it.
- [x] Re-run the new audit and verify the hierarchy violation count drops sharply.
- [x] Reduce hierarchy violations to 0.
- [ ] Re-run the full unit and e2e entrypoints without the current Vitest hang.

## Phase 4

- [ ] Reduce one-line cross-package re-export bridges where they do not provide necessary public API compatibility.
- [ ] Keep intentionally public compatibility shims only when they are part of a stable package surface.
- [ ] Prioritize the remaining 75 cross-package bridge files.
- [ ] Re-run lint, build, typecheck, unit tests, and e2e.

## Phase 5

- [ ] Work through `knip` findings in descending confidence:
  - duplicate exports
  - unused exported types
  - unused dependencies with package-level validation before removal
- [x] Eliminate the unused-file backlog.
- [ ] Re-run lint, build, typecheck, unit tests, and e2e.

## Phase 6

- [ ] Consolidate duplicated interfaces and type aliases, prioritizing exact structural matches first.
- [ ] Highest-confidence families to unify first:
  - permissions contracts
  - wallet contracts
  - app manager contracts
  - config schema and message config types
  - benchmark and trajectory transport types
- [ ] Use the collision report to drive exact-match dedupes before renames.
- [ ] Re-run lint, build, typecheck, unit tests, and e2e.

## Phase 7

- [ ] Review remaining same-name different-shape collisions and decide whether to:
  - rename for clarity
  - move to package-local names
  - keep intentionally separate
- [ ] Final verification:
  - `bun run check`
  - `bun run build`
  - `bun run typecheck`
  - `bun run test`
  - `bun run test:e2e`
