# Current System Control-Flow Map (Ground Truth)

This document maps the current control flow that trigger implementation must fit into.

It focuses on:

- Eliza task scheduling and action execution internals
- Autonomy runtime behavior
- Milady runtime/plugin boot path
- Milady API server request dispatch
- Milady frontend routing and data loading

---

## 1) Runtime Boot Path: Milady vs Core Assumptions

## 1.1 Milady startup path (`milady/src/runtime/eliza.ts`)

Current high-level flow:

1. Load config and apply environment propagation.
2. Force runtime compatibility guardrails (including bootstrap bypass):
   - `IGNORE_BOOTSTRAP=true`
3. Resolve plugin list (core + optional + installed + drop-in).
4. Build `AgentRuntime` with:
   - `createMiladyPlugin(...)`
   - resolved plugin instances
5. Pre-register critical plugins (`plugin-sql`, `plugin-local-embedding`) to avoid startup race.
6. Call `runtime.initialize()`.
7. In headless mode: return runtime to API server.
8. In non-headless mode: start API server and CLI loop.

### Practical trigger implication

The trigger plan cannot assume "core bootstrap plugin path only." Milady startup intentionally diverges from that path.

---

## 1.2 Core capability composition (`eliza/packages/typescript/src`)

There are two overlapping capability structures in current code:

- `bootstrap/*` capability stack
- `basic-capabilities/*` + `advanced-capabilities/*` stack

Both expose actions/providers/services patterns. Trigger implementation must choose a canonical insertion point and verify Milady runtime actually surfaces it.

---

## 2) Task Scheduling Control Flow

## 2.1 TaskService tick loop (`services/task.ts`)

TaskService behavior today:

1. Timer ticks every 1000ms.
2. Calls `runtime.getTasks({ tags: ["queue"] })`.
3. Validates each task:
   - has id
   - worker exists
   - optional worker `validate(...)` passes
4. For each validated task:
   - if no `repeat` tag: execute immediately then delete
   - if `repeat`:
     - evaluate interval elapsed from `updatedAt` fields
     - enforce optional `blocking` semantics
5. `executeTask(...)`:
   - mark task id in `executingTasks` set
   - for repeating tasks, update `metadata.updatedAt` before worker call
   - run worker `execute(...)`
   - delete one-off task after execute
   - clear executing marker in finally

### Important reality constraints

- `dueAt` is not part of current due logic.
- `executingTasks` lock is process-local only.
- worker exceptions do not auto-delete task; repeat scheduling behavior depends on metadata state.

---

## 2.2 Runtime task primitives (`runtime.ts`, adapter interfaces)

Task methods are pass-through to adapter:

- `createTask(...)` (defaults `worldId` to `agentId` when absent)
- `getTasks(...)`
- `getTask(...)`
- `updateTask(...)`
- `deleteTask(...)`
- task workers managed by runtime `registerTaskWorker(...)` + `getTaskWorker(...)`

### Adapter semantics (current in-memory adapter reference)

- `getTasks({ tags })` uses AND semantics for tags.
- no default sort ordering guarantee.

---

## 3) Action Control Flow (Selection -> Execution)

## 3.1 Prompt-time action filtering

`ACTIONS` provider path:

1. Retrieve candidates from `ActionFilterService` or full action list.
2. Run `action.validate(...)` in provider stage.
3. Build prompt sections:
   - names
   - descriptions
   - examples
   - call examples

### Consequence

Validation here shapes prompt candidates, but does not alone guarantee execution safety.

---

## 3.2 Runtime execution (`runtime.processActions(...)`)

Execution path:

1. Parse model-selected `actions` and optional `<params>`.
2. Resolve action by name/simile/fuzzy matching.
3. Build handler options and optional param validation diagnostics.
4. Emit `ACTION_STARTED`.
5. Execute action handler.
6. Normalize result to `ActionResult`.
7. Merge `values`/`data` into accumulated state.
8. Emit `ACTION_COMPLETED`.
9. Store action memory + adapter log.

### Critical nuance

`processActions` does not re-run `action.validate(...)` before handler call.  
Therefore handler-level guardrails are mandatory for trigger-creation actions.

---

## 4) Autonomy Control Flow

## 4.1 Service lifecycle (`autonomy/service.ts`)

Autonomy service flow:

1. Register autonomy task worker (name: `AUTONOMY_THINK`).
2. Ensure autonomous context objects exist (world/room/entity).
3. If autonomy enabled:
   - create recurring autonomy task (`queue + repeat + autonomy`)
4. On each scheduled execution:
   - run autonomous think pipeline
   - create autonomous memory message
   - process via normal runtime message pipeline

### Trigger relevance

Triggers that inject into autonomy must preserve:

- room/entity invariants
- autonomous prompt shaping and continuity
- circuit breaker/backoff behavior

---

## 4.2 Pause/Resume interactions

Milady API pause/resume endpoints call autonomy service enable/disable methods.  
A trigger design that "wakes autonomy" must avoid conflicting with user pause/resume intent.

---

## 5) Milady API Server Control Flow

## 5.1 Request dispatch model (`milady/src/api/server.ts`)

`handleRequest(...)` is a single ordered chain of `if (method/pathname)` blocks.

Dispatch characteristics:

- order-dependent matching
- mix of exact matches and `pathname.startsWith(...)`
- request auth/cors checks before endpoint logic

### Trigger endpoint implication

Route placement and parsing order are correctness-critical; shadowing bugs are easy to introduce.

---

## 5.2 Existing agent control route flow

Current `/api/agent/*` routes:

- `start`: state update + `autonomy.enableAutonomy()`
- `pause`: state update + `autonomy.disableAutonomy()`
- `resume`: state update + `autonomy.enableAutonomy()`
- `stop`: state update + `autonomy.disableAutonomy()`

These are the strongest existing API examples for trigger-autonomy interaction behavior.

---

## 5.3 Runtime availability checks

Multiple endpoints (for example workbench routes) return `503` if `state.runtime` is unavailable.  
Trigger routes should follow the same contract.

---

## 6) Milady Frontend Control Flow

## 6.1 Navigation and routing

Files:

- `apps/app/src/navigation.ts`
- `apps/app/src/components/Nav.tsx`
- `apps/app/src/App.tsx`

Current behavior:

- tab union + tab-to-path map in `navigation.ts`
- `Nav.tsx` applies additional `validTabs` filtering
- `App.tsx` routes non-chat tabs via `ViewRouter`

### Trigger page implication

Adding a tab requires changes in all three places plus any tab-conditional preloads in AppContext.

---

## 6.2 App state lifecycle (`AppContext.tsx`)

Startup path in `useEffect`:

1. auth/onboarding bootstrap with retry
2. conversation load
3. workbench load
4. websocket connect (`client.connectWs()`)
5. status event subscription (`onWsEvent("status", ...)`)
6. load status + wallet + cloud polling
7. load current tab from URL and run tab-specific preload hooks

### Trigger page implication

Trigger state requires:

- new state slots in AppContext
- load/create/update/delete/execute handlers
- tab init preload and optional interval polling

---

## 6.3 API client flow (`api-client.ts`)

Client behavior:

- typed `fetch(...)` wrapper
- WS event multiplexer by event type string
- methods organized by domain (`/api/skills`, `/api/plugins`, etc.)

Trigger API methods should follow this pattern for consistency and testability.

---

## 7) End-to-End Control Flow for the Proposed Trigger Lifecycle (Current Constraints)

Below is the required flow shape implied by current architecture.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as TriggersView
  participant Ctx as AppContext
  participant API as Milady API server.ts
  participant RT as AgentRuntime
  participant TS as TaskService
  participant TW as Trigger Worker
  participant AU as AutonomyService

  UI->>Ctx: createTrigger(formData)
  Ctx->>API: POST /api/triggers
  API->>RT: createTask(triggerTask)
  API-->>Ctx: trigger DTO
  Ctx-->>UI: state update

  loop every 1s
    TS->>RT: getTasks(tags=["queue"])
    TS->>TW: execute(trigger task)
    TW->>AU: inject trigger memory (or direct message path)
  end
```

---

## 8) Coupling and Breakpoint Map

These are the key coupling edges where trigger work can fail:

1. **Capability registration edge**
   - action implemented but not reachable in Milady runtime due capability path mismatch.

2. **Task scheduling edge**
   - trigger data model uses fields TaskService does not read.

3. **Route dispatch edge**
   - trigger route shadowed by broader route block.

4. **Frontend synchronization edge**
   - trigger state stale after background execution.

5. **Autonomy injection edge**
   - trigger message injected without explicit policy for busy/autonomy-paused states.

---

## 9) Invariants Any Trigger Implementation Must Preserve

1. Existing `/api/agent/*` pause/resume semantics remain authoritative.
2. TaskService one-off vs repeating semantics remain deterministic.
3. Action handler hard constraints do not rely only on prompt-time filtering.
4. Trigger API route ordering is deterministic and covered by tests.
5. Frontend trigger state has a defined consistency model (polling or push).

---

## 10) Summary

Current architecture is capable of supporting triggers, but only if the implementation explicitly respects:

- Milady's runtime boot/capability path,
- TaskService's actual due semantics,
- action execution realities,
- API route ordering,
- frontend consistency strategy.

The next phase docs define implementation steps under these constraints.
