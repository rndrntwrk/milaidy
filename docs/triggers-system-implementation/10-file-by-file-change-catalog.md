# File-by-File Change Catalog

This is the implementation checklist for all files touched by the trigger project.

Legend:

- **M** = mandatory in recommended path
- **C** = conditional (depends on capability/runtime path decision)
- **N** = new file

| `milady/docs/*` | M | operator runbooks and rollout notes |

---

## 10) Execution Checklist (Ordered)

1. Add trigger metadata types and schedule helpers.
2. Implement and register trigger worker.
3. Implement action creation path in capability stack used by runtime.
4. Add API trigger routes with validation and strict order.
5. Add frontend client/context/view/navigation wiring.
6. Add run records and health observability.
7. Add tests across unit/integration/e2e.
8. Roll out behind feature flags and staged gates.

---

## 11) Critical Path Verification Before Coding

Before implementation begins, verify at runtime:

1. which actions are loaded in Milady
2. which services are loaded in Milady
3. whether trigger worker registration appears in startup diagnostics

If these checks are skipped, there is a high chance of implementing into the wrong capability path.

## 12) Definition of Done Across This Catalog

Done is not "files modified." Done requires:

- all mandatory files updated,
- all mandatory tests added and passing,
- action/worker/routes confirmed in actual Milady runtime,
- feature flags and rollback controls available.
