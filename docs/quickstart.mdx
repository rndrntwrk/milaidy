This guide walks through what happens the first time you launch Milady, from installation to your first conversation.

## Install

If you haven't installed yet, the fastest path:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Desktop App">
    Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest) and open the `.dmg` (macOS), `.exe` (Windows), or `.AppImage` (Linux).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI (macOS / Linux)">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://milady-ai.github.io/milady/install.sh | bash
    milady setup
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI (Windows)">
    ```powershell
    irm https://milady-ai.github.io/milady/install.ps1 | iex
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g milaidy
    milady setup
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then start:

```bash
milady
```

## What Happens on First Run

When Milady detects no existing agent configuration (no `name` field in `~/.milady/milady.json`), it launches an interactive onboarding wizard. The wizard runs in your terminal via [@clack/prompts](https://github.com/bombshell-dev/clack) and walks through five steps: naming your agent, choosing a personality, selecting a model provider, setting up wallets, and saving everything to config.

<Info>
The onboarding wizard only runs when stdin is a TTY (interactive terminal). In headless or piped environments, Milady skips onboarding and expects a pre-configured `milady.json`.
</Info>

## The Onboarding Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Welcome">
    Milady greets you with a welcome banner:

    ```
    ┌  WELCOME TO MILADY!
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your agent">
    The wizard presents 4 randomly selected names from a pool of 55 options (Japanese-inspired names like Reimu, Sakuya, Yukari, Marisa, Koishi, Remilia, etc.) plus a "Custom..." option to type your own:

    ```
    ◇  ♡♡milady♡♡: Hey there, I'm.... err, what was my name again?
    │  ● Sakuya
    │  ○ Reimu
    │  ○ Koishi
    │  ○ Marisa
    │  ○ Custom...
    ```

    Pick a name or enter your own. The agent confirms: *"Oh that's right, I'm Sakuya!"*
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a personality">
    Select from 7 style presets that define how your agent communicates. Each preset sets the agent's bio, system prompt, writing style, adjectives, topics, and example messages:

    | Catchphrase | Hint | Description |
    |-------------|------|-------------|
    | `uwu~` | soft & sweet | Warm, gentle, kaomoji and tildes. Cozy lo-fi energy. |
    | `hell yeah` | bold & fearless | Direct, confident, ships fast. Three espressos. |
    | `lol k` | terminally online | Internet-native shorthand. Ironic, deadpan, meme-literate. |
    | `Noted.` | composed & precise | Measured, articulate, every word chosen carefully. |
    | `hehe~` | playful trickster | Mischievous, witty, sneaks wisdom inside humor. |
    | `...` | quiet intensity | Terse fragments. Ellipses for weight. Less is more. |
    | `lmao kms` | unhinged & dark | Abrasive humor, aggressive helpfulness. Roast then answer. |

    ```
    ◇  Sakuya: Now... how do I like to talk again?
    │  ● uwu~       (soft & sweet)
    │  ○ hell yeah   (bold & fearless)
    │  ○ lol k       (terminally online)
    │  ○ Noted.      (composed & precise)
    │  ○ hehe~       (playful trickster)
    │  ○ ...         (quiet intensity)
    │  ○ lmao kms    (unhinged & dark)
    ```

    The chosen preset is combined with randomly sampled lines from shared bio and system prompt pools (milady/netart/internet culture aesthetic) to create a unique character every time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a model provider">
    If no API key is already detected in your environment, the wizard asks you to pick a provider:

    ```
    ◇  Sakuya: One more thing — which AI provider should I use?
    │  ● Anthropic (Claude)
    │  ○ OpenAI (GPT)
    │  ○ OpenRouter
    │  ○ Vercel AI Gateway
    │  ○ Google Gemini
    │  ○ xAI (Grok)
    │  ○ Groq
    │  ○ DeepSeek
    │  ○ Mistral
    │  ○ Together AI
    │  ○ Ollama (local, free)
    │  ○ Skip for now
    ```

    After selecting a provider, you paste your API key (masked input). For Ollama, you confirm or change the base URL (default: `http://localhost:11434`).

    <Info>
    If Milady detects an existing API key in your environment (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is already set), it skips this step and uses the detected provider automatically.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up crypto wallets (optional)">
    The wizard offers to set up EVM and Solana wallets for on-chain interactions:

    ```
    ◇  Sakuya: Do you want me to set up crypto wallets? (for trading, NFTs, DeFi)
    │  ● Generate new wallets
    │  ○ Import existing wallets
    │  ○ Skip for now
    ```

    - **Generate new wallets** creates fresh EVM and Solana keypairs and prints the public addresses.
    - **Import existing wallets** lets you paste private keys (EVM hex or Solana base58).
    - **Skip for now** defers wallet setup. You can add wallets later through config.

    Private keys are stored in the `env` section of `~/.milady/milady.json`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuration saved">
    The wizard writes everything to `~/.milady/milady.json`:
    - Agent name and personality (bio, system prompt, style rules, adjectives, topics, examples)
    - Provider API key in the `env` section
    - Wallet keys (if generated/imported)
    - Skills registry (defaults to `https://clawhub.ai`)

    ```
    ◇  Sakuya: uwu~ Alright, that's me.
    └  Let's get started!
    ```

    The agent starts, the gateway binds, and services come online.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Onboarding

Once onboarding completes, Milady starts the following services:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Web Dashboard | `http://localhost:2138` | Chat UI, session management, agent configuration |
| Gateway | `ws://localhost:18789` | WebSocket + HTTP API for all clients and connectors |

The desktop app opens the dashboard automatically. The CLI version prints the URLs and enters the interactive chat loop or TUI.

## Your First Conversation

With the agent running, open `http://localhost:2138` in your browser or type directly in the terminal. Try a few things:

```
you: hey, what can you do?
you: help me write a python script that reads a CSV
you: /status
you: /think high
you: explain how transformers work
```

### Useful Chat Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Show session status, token count, and cost |
| `/new` or `/reset` | Clear memory, start a fresh session |
| `/compact` | Compress context (the agent summarizes the conversation) |
| `/think <level>` | Set reasoning depth: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max` |
| `/model <id>` | Switch model mid-session (e.g., `/model openai/gpt-4o`) |
| `/verbose on\|off` | Toggle verbose responses |
| `/usage off\|tokens\|full` | Control per-message token display |
| `/help` | List all available commands |

## Common First-Run Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Desktop App">
    The desktop app packages everything -- no terminal needed.

    1. Download and install from [Releases](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady/releases/latest).
    2. Launch the app. The onboarding wizard runs inside the built-in web UI.
    3. The dashboard opens automatically. Start chatting.

    The desktop app includes auto-updates, system tray integration, and native window management.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Headless Server">
    For running on a VPS or in a Docker container without a display:

    ```bash
    # Install
    curl -fsSL https://milady-ai.github.io/milady/install.sh | bash

    # Pre-configure (skip interactive onboarding)
    mkdir -p ~/.milady
    cat > ~/.milady/milady.json << 'EOF'
    {
      "agents": {
        "list": [
          {
            "id": "main",
            "name": "mila",
            "default": true
          }
        ]
      },
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-your-key-here"
      }
    }
    EOF

    # Start in server mode (no interactive chat loop)
    milady start
    ```

    The `start` command launches the API server and gateway without entering an interactive chat loop. When stdin is not a TTY (e.g., in a container), the onboarding wizard is automatically skipped, so the pre-configured `milady.json` is used directly.

    <Warning>
    When binding to `0.0.0.0` for network access, always set `MILADY_API_TOKEN` for authentication. See the [Installation](/installation#security-api-token) page.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TUI (Terminal Interface)">
    The TUI provides a rich terminal interface with live activity feed, hotkeys, and token tracking:

    ```bash
    milady tui
    ```

    Or during development:

    ```bash
    bun run tui
    ```

    The TUI expects an existing `~/.milady/milady.json` config file. Run `milady` first to go through onboarding, then switch to TUI mode.

    **TUI Hotkeys:**

    | Key | Action |
    |-----|--------|
    | `q` | Quit gracefully |
    | `r` | Restart gateway |
    | `d` | Open dashboard in browser |
    | `l` | Toggle log view |
    | `c` | Compact/clear activity |
    | `?` | Show help |
    | Arrow keys | Scroll activity |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Existing ElizaOS Users">
    Milady is built on ElizaOS, so the plugin system, action/provider/evaluator patterns, and character format are all compatible. Key differences:

    - **Config location**: `~/.milady/milady.json` instead of an inline character file.
    - **Gateway**: Milady adds a multiplexed WebSocket + HTTP gateway on port 18789.
    - **Onboarding**: The first-run wizard generates a character from style presets and random pool sampling.
    - **Plugin manager**: Install plugins via `milady plugins install <name>` -- they are tracked in config and auto-loaded.
    - **Skills**: Markdown-based extensions via ClawHub registry, separate from the plugin system.

    Existing ElizaOS plugins are fully compatible. Add them to your config or install via the plugin manager.
