<Warning>
This plugin is not yet available in the Milady plugin registry. To use Perplexity models today, configure them through the [OpenRouter plugin](/plugin-registry/llm/openrouter) using the appropriate model ID.
</Warning>

The Perplexity plugin connects Milady agents to Perplexity's search-augmented language models. These models combine LLM reasoning with live web search, making them ideal for agents that need up-to-date information.

> **On-demand plugin.** This plugin is resolved from the remote elizaOS plugin registry and auto-installs when its API key is detected. It is not included in Milady's bundled `plugins.json` index.

**Package:** `@elizaos/plugin-perplexity`

## Installation

```bash
milady plugins install @elizaos/plugin-perplexity
```

## Auto-Enable

The plugin auto-enables when `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is present:

```bash
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-...
```

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Required | Description |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|
