The App Control plugin lets Milady agents manage apps through conversation.

**Package:** `@elizaos/plugin-app-control`

## Overview

This plugin exposes app lifecycle management to agents, backed by the `/api/apps` endpoints. Agents can launch installed apps, close running ones, and list what is currently active — all through natural language commands instead of the dashboard UI.

Key capabilities:

- **Launch apps** — start an installed Milady app by name.
- **Close apps** — stop a running app.
- **List running apps** — see which apps are currently active.
- **Chat-driven control** — manage the app lifecycle without leaving the conversation.

## Installation

```bash
milady plugins install app-control
```

## Configuration

No environment variables or configuration parameters are required. The plugin communicates with the Milady API server directly.

## Usage Examples

> "Launch the dashboard app."

> "What apps are currently running?"

> "Close the monitoring app."
