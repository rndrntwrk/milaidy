The Knowledge plugin provides a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Milady agents. It enables agents to retrieve relevant information from a document corpus and inject it into the LLM context.

**Package:** `@elizaos/plugin-knowledge` (core plugin — always loaded)

## Overview

The Knowledge plugin manages the full RAG pipeline:

1. **Ingest** — Documents are chunked and embedded on upload
2. **Index** — Embeddings are stored in the vector store (backed by the SQL plugin)
3. **Retrieve** — At inference time, the query is embedded and similar chunks are retrieved
4. **Inject** — Retrieved chunks are injected into the agent prompt as context

## Installation

The Knowledge plugin is loaded automatically. No installation is required.

## Supported File Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.txt` | Plain text |
| `.md` | Markdown |
| `.pdf` | PDF documents (via `@elizaos/plugin-pdf`) |
| `.json` | JSON data |
| `.csv` | Comma-separated values |
| `.html` | HTML pages (stripped to text) |

## Adding Knowledge

### Via the Admin Panel

Navigate to **Agent → Knowledge** and upload documents through the file picker.

### Via the REST API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MILADY_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf" \
  -F "agentId=your-agent-id"
```

### Via Configuration

Place documents in the knowledge directory specified in `milady.json`:

```json
{
  "knowledge": {
    "directory": "./knowledge",
    "autoIngest": true
  }
}
```

### Via Character File

```json
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "knowledge": [
    "This agent specializes in TypeScript and Node.js development.",
    "The project uses ElizaOS core version 2.x.",
    { "path": "./docs/api-reference.md" }
  ]
}
```

## Retrieval Configuration

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `knowledge.topK` | Number of chunks to retrieve per query | `5` |
| `knowledge.minScore` | Minimum similarity score (0–1) | `0.7` |
| `knowledge.chunkSize` | Characters per chunk | `1000` |
| `knowledge.chunkOverlap` | Overlap between adjacent chunks | `200` |

```json
{
  "knowledge": {
    "topK": 5,
    "minScore": 0.7,
    "chunkSize": 1000,
    "chunkOverlap": 200
  }
}
```

## Embedding Model

By default, knowledge embeddings use the local embedding model provided by `@elizaos/plugin-local-embedding` (Nomic Embed Text v1.5, 768 dimensions). This runs entirely on-device — no API key required.

To use a different embedding model, configure it in `milady.json`:

```json
{
  "embedding": {
    "model": "nomic-embed-text-v1.5.Q5_K_M.gguf",
    "dimensions": 768
  }
}
```

## Knowledge Provider

At inference time, the Knowledge plugin's provider:

1. Embeds the current user message
2. Searches the vector store for semantically similar chunks
3. Injects retrieved chunks into the prompt as a `# Knowledge` block

The provider runs with `position: -5` (before most other providers) to ensure knowledge is available when the LLM generates its response.

```
# Knowledge

[Retrieved chunk 1]

[Retrieved chunk 2]

[Retrieved chunk 3]
```

## Actions

The Knowledge plugin registers the following actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE` | Explicitly search the knowledge base and return results |
| `ADD_KNOWLEDGE` | Add a new document or text snippet to the knowledge base |

## Knowledge API

```typescript
// From any plugin with access to the runtime:
const results = await runtime.searchKnowledge({
  query: "How does the payment system work?",
  topK: 5,
  minScore: 0.7,
});

for (const result of results) {
  console.log(result.content, result.score);
}
```
