The Agent Skills plugin implements the Agent Skills specification for **elizaOS**, giving agents the ability to discover, load, and execute skills with progressive disclosure.

**Package:** `@elizaos/plugin-agent-skills` (core plugin — always loaded)

## Overview

Skills are self-contained capabilities that agents can acquire and invoke at runtime. The Agent Skills plugin manages the full skill lifecycle: discovery from a registry, installation into a local directory, auto-loading on startup, and runtime invocation. Progressive disclosure ensures that only relevant skills surface to the planner on each turn, keeping context focused.

## Installation

This plugin is a core plugin and is always loaded. No manual installation is required.

## Configuration

| `SKILLS_REGISTRY` | string | No | Skill registry URL (default: `https://clawhub.ai`) |
| `BUNDLED_SKILLS_DIRS` | string | No | Comma-separated list of directories containing bundled (read-only) skills |
