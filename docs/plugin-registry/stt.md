The Speech-to-Text (STT) plugin enables Milady agents to transcribe audio input into text, powering voice-based interactions.

> **On-demand plugin.** This plugin is resolved from the remote elizaOS plugin registry and auto-installs when configured. It is not included in Milady's bundled `plugins.json` index.

milady plugins install @elizaos/plugin-stt
```

The STT plugin uses the configured model provider for transcription. No additional API key is needed beyond your primary provider.
