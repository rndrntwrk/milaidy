The RSS plugin adds news and feed support to Milady agents.

**Package:** `@elizaos/plugin-rss`

## Overview

This plugin lets agents subscribe to RSS feeds and receive new content as it is published. Agents can monitor news sources, blogs, and other syndicated content, then summarize or act on new items. Feeds are polled on a configurable interval.

## Installation

```bash
milady plugins install rss
```

## Auto-Enable

Auto-enables when `RSS_FEEDS` is set.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `RSS_FEEDS` | string | No | Comma-separated list of RSS feed URLs |
| `RSS_POLL_INTERVAL` | string | No | Poll interval in minutes |

Set via environment variables or in your agent configuration:

```bash
export RSS_FEEDS="https://example.com/feed.xml,https://blog.example.com/rss"
export RSS_POLL_INTERVAL="15"
```
